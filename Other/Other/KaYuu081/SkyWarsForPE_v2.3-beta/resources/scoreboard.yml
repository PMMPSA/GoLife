# Scoreboards:
# - As you might know, scoreboards is bla bla bla...
#   But here is the important things.
#   -> The scoreboard are in descending order. From 15-1
#      From down to up.
#   -> We have limited empty spaces due to mojang tomf*ckery
#   -> They must be in array.
#   -> You can simplify '§' as '&'
#   -> The maximum arrays in one scoreboard is 15, Please follow this
#      otherwise we will complain about it in console.
